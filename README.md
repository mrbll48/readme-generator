## Description

This application can be used to easily create a README for any application. It will generate a polished README that can be further added to if the need arises.

## Installation

The application requires a package.json file in order to run. Simply run the command line "npm init" to install the necessary file. The application also requires inquirer to run. You can run "npm i inquirer@8.2.4" from the terminal to install the necessary packages to properly run.

## Usage

Once the necessary files are installed, you will need to run the command node index.js in order to run the application. The application will ask a series of questions that you answer, and as you answer it will generate a section for your response to go into on the README file. Once you have answered all of the questions the README will generate and you can see the markdown file. For each license option you choose a badge will be placed at the top of the readme. The video linked below will show the functionality of the application.
